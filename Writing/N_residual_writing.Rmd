# Abstract 

On-farm precision experiments (OFPE) have become valuable tools for determining nitrogen (N) rates that increase economic profits while potentially reduce environmental impacts. However, despite the insights gained from OFPE, no studies have examined the impact of applying variable N rates on soil residual N in fields where these experiments were conducted. We suspect that applying variable N rates may lead to differing levels of residual soil N, which could, in turn, influence the yield response to N in the following year and affect the optimal N rate for that site. This study uses the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the process of applying variable N on a hypothetical field with corn-corn and corn-soybean rotations, using a completely randomized trial design of N across years and a consistent trial design of N, respectively. Results show that soil N heterogeneity, caused by variable N application, is most pronounced in continuous corn rotations with a consistent trial design each year. In contrast, fields with corn-soybean rotations exhibit less soil N heterogeneity, likely because soybeans, as legumes, play a vital role in enriching and balancing soil nitrogen levels through biological nitrogen fixation when grown between two years of corn. The presence of soil N heterogeneity increases the variability in site-specific economically optimal N rate (EONR), thereby increasing the profit difference between site-specific and field-uniform EONR. Consequently, the EONR estimated from observed OFPE data may differ from the true field-uniform EONR. However, in the corn-soybean rotation system, we find no significant difference between the true uniform EONR and the OFPE-estimated EONR.

(key variables N and soil N, since how you apply N will affect soil residual N). 






# Introduction

 + There have been studies showing that residual N in soil may affect the next year's EONR.
 + OFPE is a useful way to provide information for agricultrual practices, and it is getting more popular.
 + No studies have explored the impact of OFPE on fields, other than providing fields information and finding EOIRs
 + We used APSIM and found that running OFPE can create field heterogenouity, which can increase the vatiation of EONRs for the next year due to different N applications in each site and then result in different residual N in soil. 
  + This is more relavent to corn-corn rotation
  + For corn-soy rotation, the field heterogenouity still exsits, but it is way smaller than corn-corn
  + The degree/range of field heterogenouity caused by residual N varys by precipitation.
+ Implication: 
  + Corn-soy rotation can mitigate field heterogenouity due to OFPE
  + Do not use consistent trial design over years
  + How much N applied this year will affect the yield response in the next year, they are continous events. Future studies can work on finding EONR considering multiple years? 
  + This heterogenouity is caused by VRT, so, more VRT are used, more VRT are needed? 
  + This may bring more attention to farmers in somewhere like IL? As the fields in IL have black, flat, and relatively more homogenous soil within the field. 
  + Need more observations to esitimate EONR, the small plots may not reliable? 



# Material and Methods

+ APSIM's general info in a few sentences with citations
+ APSIM prameters setup for simulations
  + soil
  + crop
  + weather
  + mangement
+ Trial design 
  + random trial design over years
  + same trial design over years
  + corn-corn rotation 
  + corn-soy rotation
+ Simulate true yield response functions and estimate the 3 kinds of EONR


# Results

+ True yield response functions under 4 scenarios
  + Results indicate that in OPFE, the soil N heterogeneity is most pronounced in corn-corn rotations with a consistent trial design each year, followed by corn-corn rotations using a randomized trial design each year. Fields with corn-soy rotations exhibit less heterogeneity due to variable N application.  This is likely because when soybeans are grown between two years of corn, as legumes, soybeans play a vital role in enriching soil nitrogen levels through biological nitrogen fixation.
