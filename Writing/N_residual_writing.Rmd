# Abstract 

On-farm precision experiments (OFPE) have become valuable tools for determining nitrogen (N) rates that increase economic profits while potentially reduce environmental impacts. However, despite the insights gained from OFPE, no studies have examined the impact of applying variable N rates on soil residual N in fields where these experiments were conducted. We suspect that applying variable N rates may lead to differing levels of residual soil N, which could, in turn, influence the following year’s yield response to N and affect the optimal N rate for that site. This could potentially bias the yield response estimation when using OFPE data. This study uses the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the process of applying variable N on a hypothetical field with corn-corn and corn-soybean rotations, using a completely randomized trial design of N across years and a consistent trial design of N, respectively. Results show that soil N heterogeneity, caused by variable N application, is most pronounced in continuous corn rotations with a consistent trial design each year. In contrast, fields with corn-soybean rotations exhibit less soil N heterogeneity, likely because soybeans, as legumes, play a vital role in enriching and balancing soil nitrogen levels through biological nitrogen fixation when grown between two years of corn. The presence of soil N heterogeneity increases the variability in site-specific economically optimal N rate (EONR), thereby increasing the profit difference between site-specific and field-uniform EONR. Consequently, the EONR estimated from observed OFPE data may differ from the true field-uniform EONR. However, in the corn-soybean rotation system, we find no significant difference between the true uniform EONR and the OFPE-estimated EONR.

# Introduction

As optimal input rates usually vary across and within fields, precision agriculture (PA) technology has been increasingly adopted by farmers[@mcfadden2023precision]. On-farm precision experimentation (OFPE), where researchers and farmers collaborate using PA tools to collect data, started in the late 1990s and has also been increasingly conducted to provide valuable information for field characteristics and profitability at specific fields [@cook1998precision; @bullock2002adding; @pringle2004field; @panten2010enhancing; @paccioretti2021statistical; @hegedus2023towards]. OFPE typically relies on variable rate applicators (VRA) to apply different input rates based on a field trial design, allowing for the estimation of the relationship between inputs and yield. The data and insights gained from OFPE have shown potential for identifying optimal input rates that enhance economic returns while potentially reducing environmental impacts [@bullock2019data]. However, despite these benefits, no studies have examined the impact of applying variable nitrogen rates on residual soil nitrogen in fields where these experiments were conducted.

Empirical studies have consistently shown that residual soil N levels are significantly attected by N fertilizer applications and vary with changes in  application rates [@hong2007economically; @ferguson2002site; @alotaibi2018economic; @belanger2003residual; @jokela1989corn]. @roth1990soil showed that soil residual N not only varies after the harvest of corn fertilized at different N rates but can also accumulate and be present in substantial amounts in the spring, indicating the need to consider residual soil N in N management. However, except the preplant soil nitrate test (PPNT) tool [@magdoff1984soil; @bundy1995soil; @schroder2000does], current N recommendation tools rarely account for the residual soil N from previous fertilizer applications when calculating economically optimal rates. Therefore, we suspect that applying variable nitrogen rates in OFPE may result in differing levels of residual soil nitrogen, which could, in turn, influence the following year’s yield response to applied nitrogen and affect the optimal rate for that site. This variation could potentially bias yield response estimations and the recommendations for economically optimal nitrogen rates (EONR) when using OFPE data. The main objective of this study is to examine the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil nitrogen caused by OFPE and its impact on economic evaluations. 

We use the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the process of applying variable N on a hypothetical field with corn-corn and corn-soybean rotations, using a completely randomized trial design of N across years and a consistent trial design of N, respectively. Results show that soil N heterogeneity, caused by variable N application, is most pronounced in continuous corn rotations with a consistent trial design each year, followed by the continuous corn rotation field with randomized trial design each year. In contrast, fields with corn-soybean rotations exhibit less soil N heterogeneity, likely because soybeans, as legumes, play a vital role in enriching and balancing soil nitrogen levels through biological nitrogen fixation when grown between two years of corn. The presence of soil N heterogeneity increases the variability in site-specific economically optimal N rate (EONR), thereby increasing the profit difference between site-specific and field-uniform EONR. Consequently, the EONR estimated from observed OFPE data may differ from the true field-uniform EONR. However, in the corn-soybean rotation system, we find no significant difference between the true uniform EONR and the OFPE-estimated EONR. 



 + We used APSIM and found that running OFPE can create field heterogenouity, which can increase the variation of EONRs for the next year due to different N applications in each site and then result in different residual N in soil. 

In this study, we tested the hypothesis 


  + This is more relavent to corn-corn rotation
  + For corn-soy rotation, the field heterogenouity still exsits, but it is way smaller than corn-corn
  + The degree/range of field heterogenouity caused by residual N varys by precipitation.
+ Implication: 
  + Corn-soy rotation can mitigate field heterogenouity due to OFPE
  +  use consistent trial design over years
  + How much N applied this year will affect the yield response in the next year, they are continous events. Future studies can work on finding EONR considering multiple years? 




# Material and Methods

## The APSIM Modeling Platform and Crop Models

The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) is an open-source, advanced agricultural systems simulator that integrates various process-based models within a modular framework [@holzworth2014apsim; @keating2003overview]. Further details on APSIM and its performance across various studies are available at http://www.apsim.info. The crop models in APSIM simulate crop growth by capturing a comprehensive set of physiological processes, including phenology, organ development, and water and nutrient uptake, among others. These processes operate on a daily time step and respond to environmental conditions and management practices. By accounting for a broad spectrum of growth factors, APSIM provides an accurate and dynamic view of how crops interact with their environment, allowing us to examine how applied fertilizer nitrogen may influence residual soil nitrogen accumulation in the spring and, consequently, affect yield response later in the growing season [@keating2003overview; @holzworth2014apsim].


The crop models used in this study include corn [@carberry1991tailoring] and soybean [@robertson1998simulating] crop models. The SOILN module [@probert1998apsim] in APSIM was used to model soil N and C cycling, as well as to simulate nitrogen mineralization from soil organic matter, thereby generating the nitrogen supply available to a crop from the soil. Clarion loam soil was used as the soil type in the simulated field, soil profile information can be obtained from https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm. 


The simulation process was consecutive to account for carry-over effects for seven years without annual re-initialization between each growing season. The crop management prameters were held constant across years for each crop type. planting depth was cm for corn and cm for soybean. Plant polulation was  and plants $m^{2}$ for corn and soysean, respectively. Tillage operations.

# Results

+ True yield response functions under 4 scenarios
  + Results indicate that in OPFE, the soil N heterogeneity is most pronounced in corn-corn rotations with a consistent trial design each year, followed by corn-corn rotations using a randomized trial design each year. Fields with corn-soy rotations exhibit less heterogeneity due to variable N application.  This is likely because when soybeans are grown between two years of corn, as legumes, soybeans play a vital role in enriching soil nitrogen levels through biological nitrogen fixation.
